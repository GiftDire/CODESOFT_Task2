Features:
    >Upload an image via a graphical user interface (GUI)
    >Automatically generate a caption using a pre-trained model
    >Supports common image formats: .jpg, .png, .jpeg, .bmp, .gif
    >Runs on CPU or GPU (if available) for faster processing
Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed. Then install the required dependencies using:
>pip install torch transformers pillow tkinter
